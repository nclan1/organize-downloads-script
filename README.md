# organize-downloads-script
instead of manually sorting each file in your downloads into a filetype folder, use a script to automate that process and clean it up!

# why 
i had over 900(!!!!) files laying around in my downlaods folder over the years and i found out that you could write a script in python that could automatically sort your downloads into folders of its respective filetype! i looked around and found some resources that taught and showed me how i could write this script!

# get started
* firstly i had to create the respective folder types in my downloads (you could automate this part too!).
    * images
    * audio
    * code
    * compressed-file
    * docs
    * other
    * software
    * video
* change the download paths to your own path
* run it

some notes: it should leave folders within your downloads alone and you can choose what to do with those yourself. 

thank you!
